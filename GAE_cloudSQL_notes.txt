# to run the local server, you have to set up the "SQL Proxy", which allows
# remote servers to use a local UNIX socket to represent the server inside
# the Google network.
#
# (Your database should use the *Public* IP, not private - but don't allocate
# any enabled IP addresses!)

Download the tool onto the local machine:
    https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/sql-proxy

Then run:
    ./cloud_sql_proxy -dir=/cloudsql -instances=russ-websocket-experiments:us-central1:russ-experiments-sql
