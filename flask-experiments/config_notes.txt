Flask on Apache:
----------------

NOTE: I haven't figured out how to make Flask work with Python3 on EC2.
      So note the use of 'pip' instead of 'pip3' below.

sudo yum install mod_wsgi
sudo pip install flask

Write your .wsgi file
    # why do I have to add this to the path?  Why doesn't it automatically
    # happen from WSGI???
    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0, "/home/ec2-user/flask-experiments/cgi-bin")
    from flask_experiments import app as application

Add some rules to httpd.conf (see link above)
    <IfModule wsgi_module>
      WSGIDaemonProcess app
               # do *NOT* include a trailing slash here, or it will be
               # a circle of redirects.  Does this also apply if it's
               # the root path???
      WSGIScriptAlias /flask "/home/ec2-user/flask-experiments/cgi-bin/app.wsgi"

      <Directory "/home/ec2-user/flask-experiments/cgi-bin">
          WSGIProcessGroup app
          WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
          Require all granted
      </Directory>
    </IfModule>
